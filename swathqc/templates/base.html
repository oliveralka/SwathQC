        <div class="img_description"><h2>PeakWidth over RT</h2>
            <p>Peak Width over RT detects LC performance. Narrow peaks mean better chromatographic resolution.
                An increase in median peak width over time means peaks are getting wider.
                An increased number of spectra should manifest itself in a broader boxplot, but medians should remain stable.
                <br>
                Peak With is plotted here in boxplots in 5 minute intervals over the span of the retention time.
                The Peak Width metric used here is  calculated as the difference between left with and right width of the chromatographic peak.
                As an alternative FWHM could be considered.
                <br>
                Peak Width can be plotted from OpenSwathWorkflow output (osw, tsv) or Pyprophet Files (osw, tsv).
                Column names used for plotting differ between tsv
                ( 'RT', 'rightWidth' and 'leftWidth) and osw ('EXP\_RT', 'RIGHT\_WIDTH' and 'LEFT\_WIDTH').

            <p>The library contains 6 transitions for each feature.
                For each feature, the number of recovered transitions are counted from the column
            'aggr_peak_area' in tsv files and and 'AREA_INTENSITY' from the FEATURE_TRANSITION_TABLE in osw files.
           Only non zero area intensities will be counted.
           Files from pyprophet or TRIC contains all features and transitions from merged swath files, so the total
           number will be much higher. But the number of features with only 1 - 3 transitions should go down considerably,
           as these low quality features get filtered out.</p>

            <p>Missed Cleavages are calculated by OpenSwathWorkflow, by doing an in situ digest (assuming Trypsin)
                and the number of missed cleavages for each peptide is placed in a column 'MC'.
                A histogram plot of missed cleavages conveys an impression of the quality of sample preparation.
                For that all peptides tagged as decoy are dropped  before plotting and transitions groups are grouped
                so that each peptide is counted only once.
                <br>Missed cleavages are only available from tsv output of OpenSwathWorkflow, not to the osw files in the SQlite based workflow.

            <p>The mass error or (mass accuracy) describes the difference between the measured m/z of and ion and the
                real m/z, that is calculated for the identified ion and reported in part per million (ppm).
                It reports on the quality of a mass spectrometry run and its identifications (IDs).
                Since ID depends on adjustable parameters, the spread of mass error should reflect the user parameters.
                The mean of the distribution should lie around 0, else it may indicate instrument bias.
                <br>
                The distribution of mass errors is plotted in a histogram.
                Since each ID has multiple MS2 peaks, where each peak has a mass error attached,
                the mean is calculated for each MS2 spectrum before plotting.
                <br>
                This plot is currently only available from OpenSwathWorkflow tsv, because the information is not yet included in the osw file. </p>

                <br>Ideally RT difference remains around 0, there is a +/- 5 minute tolerance interval that is considered acceptable
                The default RT window width in OpenSwathWorkflow is +/- 5 minutes (or 600s).
                If it seems to run out of the frame, might be an indication to increase the parameter (\texttt{-rt\_extraction\_window}) in OpenSwathWorkflow.
                <br> RT correlation is plotted from PyProphets export tsv file.
            A scatter plot is produced of normalized 'iRT' against 'delta_iRT' if available, else 'RT' against 'delta\_rt'. And only targets are considered.
Because this file may contain IDs from multiple runs, the mean is calculated for each identified peptide before plotting.
